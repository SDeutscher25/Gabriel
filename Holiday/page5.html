        <p style="color: aliceblue">
            A birthday is the anniversary of the birth of a person, or figuratively of an institution. The birthdays of
            people are celebrated in numerous cultures, often with birthday gifts, birthday cards, a birthday party, or
            a rite of passage.

        <h3 style="color: aqua">Egyptian Birthday Heirarchy</h3>
        <p style="color: aliceblue">
            The earliest recorded birthday celebrations date back to ancient Egypt. Initially, birthdays weren't
            celebrated for individuals as we do today; they were more associated with gods and pharaohs. The everyday
            person sadly wasn't deemed worthy to be celebrated annually.

                In Ghana, on their birthday, children wake up to a special treat called "oto" which is a patty made from
                mashed sweet potato and eggs fried in palm oil. Later they have a birthday party where they usually eat
                stew and rice and a dish known as "kelewele", which is fried plantain chunks.

                Jewish boys have a bar mitzvah on their 13th birthday. Jewish girls have a bat mitzvah on their 12th
                birthday, or sometimes on their 13th birthday in Reform and Conservative Judaism. This marks the
                transition where they become obligated in commandments from which they were previously exempted and are
                counted as part of the community.

        <h3 style="color: aqua">Birthday Traditions</h3>
        <p style="color: aliceblue">
            In certain parts of the world, an individual's birthday is celebrated by a party featuring a specially made
            cake. It may be decorated with lettering and the person's age, or studded with the same number of lit
            candles as the age of the individual. The celebrated individual may make a silent wish and attempt to blow
            out the candles in one breath; if successful, superstition holds that the wish will be granted. In many
            cultures, the wish must be kept secret or it will not "come true".
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: aqua">Name Days</h3>
        <p style="color: aliceblue">In some historically Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox countries,[a] it is common to have a 'name day',
        otherwise known as a 'Saint's day'. It is celebrated in much the same way as a birthday, but it is held on the
        official day of a saint with the same Christian name as the birthday person; the difference being that one may
        look up a person's name day in a calendar, or easily remember common name days (for example, John or Mary);
        however in pious traditions, the two were often made to concur by giving a newborn the name of a saint
        celebrated on its day of confirmation, more seldom one's birthday. Some are given the name of the religious
        feast of their christening's day or birthday, for example, Noel or Pascal (French for Christmas and "of
            Easter"); as another example, Togliatti was given Palmiro as his first name because he was born on Palm Sunday</p>
