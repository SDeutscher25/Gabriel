                The Venom symbiote's first human host was Spider-Man himself, who eventually discovered its true
                nefarious nature and separated himself from the creature in The Amazing Spider-Man #258 (November 1984)
                with a brief rejoining five months later in Web of Spider-Man.

                The symbiote went on to merge with other hosts, beginning with Eddie Brock, its second host, with whom
                it first became Venom. Venom has endured as one of Spider-Man's most prominent villains, and was
                initially regarded as one of his three archenemies, alongside the Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus. Since
                his debut however, Venom has evolved into an antiheroic figure, slowly distancing himself from his
                initial goal to ruin Spider-Man's life to try and do good instead, even putting aside his differences
                with and helping Spider-Man at times. In 1993, Venom would transition into having a role as an antihero
                vigilante in the Venom: Lethal Protector comic book series.

                After Brock, numerous other hosts for Venom followed, including the villain Mac Gargan, who was the main
                incarnation of Venom from 2005 to 2009, and Flash Thompson, who became the superhero Agent Venom from
                2011 to 2016, before Venom returned to Brock in 2017. Venom's most recent and current host is Brock's
                biological son, Dylan. Venom is also depicted as having spawned several childrenâ€”Scream, Lasher, Phage,
                Agony, Riot, Mania, Sleeper, and Carnage, who becomes Venom's archenemy after bonding with serial killer
                Cletus Kasady.

                A fan-favorite character and well-known figure in popular culture, Venom (primarily the Eddie Brock
                incarnation) is the most recognizable Spider-Man antagonist not first introduced during the original
