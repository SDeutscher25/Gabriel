        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Butter: I use salted butter, but unsalted butter would also be great. I just recommend tasting the dough
                to ensure that it’s salted to your liking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Eggs: if you’d like to find great egg substitutions that still make perfect cookies – see my eggless
                chocolate chip cookies recipe.
            </li>
            <li>White Sugar: You can use granulated white sugar or organic cane sugar.</li>
            <li>Brown sugar: I use light brown sugar in this recipe for the best results.</li>
            <li>
                Flour: I recommend using an unbleached, all-purpose flour to make these chocolate chip cookies. Many
                readers have used gluten-free all-purpose flour with excellent results. Or, try these gluten-free
                chocolate chip cookies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sea Salt: I exclusively bake and cook with pure, fine sea salt. Sea salt is different than table salt
                (that is iodized), so if you use salt other than sea salt I recommend testing the recipe first with 1/2
                tsp and then adjusting to your taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Chocolate Chips: As you can see from the photos, sometimes I use chocolate chunks, chopped chocolate, or
                chocolate chips: It doesn’t matter what you use, as long as you use 2 cups.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The first step in making these easy chocolate chip cookies to to combine the dry ingredients in a medium
                size bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, cream together butter and sugars, make sure to soften the butter early by taking it out of the
                fridge at least two hours before baking so it’s ready to go when you need it. You can also warm it in
                the microwave for about 7 seconds, but be very careful not to melt it.
            </li>
            <li>Once butter/sugar mixture is beaten well, add the eggs & vanilla and beat to combine.</li>
            <li>
                Add dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Then add the chocolate chips and beat until they are
                evenly distributed throughout the dough.
            </li>
            <li>Use LOTS of chocolate chips. You want at least two gooey chocolate chips in every bite.</li>
            <li>
                The chocolate chip cookie dough should be easy to roll and not sticky. It should not be dry or crumbly.
                See photo below for the optimal texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the cookie dough is finished, it’s time to portion and roll the dough. I know many people eyeball
                it when making cookies, however I highly recommend using a cookie scoop.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are baking the cookies immediately simply roll them into balls, place them evenly apart on a
                baking sheet (about 1.5 to 2 inches apart) and bake at 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                The most important piece of advice I can give you is – DO NOT over-bake these chocolate chip cookies!
                They will not look done when you pull them out of the oven, and that is GOOD.
            </li>
            <li>
                At the end of the baking time, these chocolate chip cookies won’t look done but they are. They will look
                a little doughy when you remove them from the oven, and thats good. They may be lightly browned in a few
                places, which is exactly how you want them.
            </li>
            <li>
                They will set up as they sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes. I never bake them for more than 9
                minutes
            </li>
        </ol>
