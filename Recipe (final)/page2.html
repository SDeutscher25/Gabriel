        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Butter: Butter is the base of any delicious cookie recipe. Make sure you are using room temperature
                butter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Brown Sugar + Granulated Sugar: Sugar is not only used for sweetness, but also for providing structure
                and tenderness. I like to use more brown sugar than white sugar because (1) brown sugar has incredible
                flavor and (2) brown sugar contains more moisture than white, which produces a softer cookie.
            </li>
            <li>Eggs: Eggs help bind everything together. You need 2 eggs in this recipe.</li>
            <li>Pure Vanilla Extract + Salt: Both provide flavor.</li>
            <li>Cinnamon: Raisins, oats, and cinnamon are winning flavor combination.</li>
            <li>Baking Soda: Baking soda helps the cookies rise.</li>
            <li>
                Molasses: Molasses is my secret ingredient! 1 scant Tablespoon enhances all the wonderful flavors of
                these buttery, cinnamon-sweet oatmeal raisin cookies.
            </li>
            <li>Flour: Flour is the structure of the cookies.</li>
            <li>
                Oats: There are a ton of oats in this recipe! Oats provide a fabulously chewy texture. I use and
                recommend old fashioned whole oats here—just like I do for flourless peanut butter oatmeal cookies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Raisins: I love to soak the raisins in warm water before using. This step is optional, but it guarantees
                they are plump and soft. Blot dry before adding to cookie dough.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cream butter + sugars: Use a hand or stand mixer to cream the softened butter with both sugars until
                smooth, about 2 minutes on medium speed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add eggs, vanilla, + molasses: Add eggs, then mix on high for about 1 minute until incorporated. Add
                vanilla and molasses, mix until combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dry ingredients: Mix flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a separate bowl. Pour this into
                the wet ingredients. Combine together on low.
            </li>
            <li>Add the extras: Beat in the oats and raisins on low speed. Dough will be thick and sticky.</li>
            <li>Chill: Refrigerate the cookie dough for 30-60 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                Roll: Roll cookie dough into balls and place on a lined baking sheet. I love using these baking mats.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake: Bake the cookies at 350°F (177°C) for 12-13 minutes until lightly browned. The cookies might look
                under-baked, but they will continue to set as they cool. This is the secret to a soft and chewy oatmeal
                raisin cookie!
